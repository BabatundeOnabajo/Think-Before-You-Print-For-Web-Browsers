# Think-Before-You-Print-For-Web-Browsers
Think Before You Print For Web Browsers is an extension for web browsers that asks the end user if they really need to print an online document. The extension is unaffiliated but continues on from the official campaign by many businesses and organisations in the United Kingdom to reduce paper waste.

# Background
Many businesses and organisations in the United Kingdom try to reduce paper waste. Paper waste accounts for a significant amount of waste: in the United Kingdom alone, the council West Lothian state that arpimd 6.3 million tonnes of paper are thrown away by UK households every year. Paper waste is a significant problem. For businesses, they represent a waste of resources that could and should be better spent elsewhere. The organisation StopWaste.org cite one source that states that inefficient use of printers, copiers and fax machines can waste between 1 and 3 percent of a company's revenue annually. For the environment, the problem is potentially greater - when paper is thrown away, it gets sent to a landfill. If it is not recycled, it causes methane when it is broken down. Furthermore, paper waste also contributes to deforestation, harming biodiversity in areas of the world such as the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. It takes around 24 trees to make one tonne of paper, which highlights the significant strain that paper waste imposes on the environment.  

It is customary in the UK to see many businesses and other organisations have the following in their email signature: **"Think Before You Print"**. This browser extension goes one step further by asking the user to think before they print as they are about to print an online document. This is more effective than an email signature as it is frequently overlooked or in many cases the end user becomes immune to the call to the action after seeing it several times. By contrast, this browser asks the end user to think before they print as they are actually about to print. It is hoped that this **free** extension help minimise paper waste by businesses and organisations in the UK and elsewhere around the world.
