# Think-Before-You-Print-For-Web-Browsers
Think Before You Print For Web Browsers is an extension for web browsers that asks the end user if they really need to print an online document. The extension is unaffiliated but continues on from the official campaign by many businesses and organisations in the United Kingdom to reduce paper waste.
